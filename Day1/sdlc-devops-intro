# Software development lifecycle

7 phases
==========

	1. Requirement Gathering:- 
==========================

Obj:- understand what client needs
Activities:- meet stakeholder's:- clients, users, managers
	Ø Gather functional & nonfunctional requirements 

Output:- software requirement specification (SRS) document

	2. Planning
============

Obj:- create a project plan
Activities:- define scope, budget, and resources
	Ø Time and cost estimation
	Ø Risk analysis
Output:- project plan document

	3. Design
=========

Obj:- blueprint of how the system will work
Activates:
=======
	Ø HLD:-high level design:- architecture, technologies, database design
	Ø LLD:-low level design:- module designs, interface design, algorithm 

Output:- design documents for HLD&LLD

	4. Implementation(coding)
========================

Obj:-  write actual source code

Activities 
=========

	Ø Developers follow coding guidelines 
	Ø Use vcs for git
	Ø Unit testing by developers 

Output:- working source code modules

	5. Testing 
===========

Obj:- ensure software works as expected 

Activities
========

	Ø QA team tests the app using test cases
	Ø Types:- unit testing, integration testing, system testing, UAT:- User acceptancy test
	Ø Bug reporting and fixing

Output:- test report, defect log

	6. DEPLOYMENT 
===============

Obj: deliver software to end-users

Activities 
==========

	Ø Deploy to production env or staging env
	Ø Conduct deployment verification 
	Ø Use tools like Jenkins, docker, k8s, and aws or any cloud

Output:- live/released product

	7. Maintenance 
================

Obj: keep the software up-to-date

Activities:-
=========

	Ø Bug fixes 
	Ø Updates, patches, security upgrades
	Ø Feature enhancements based on the feedback

Output: stable software overtime


Benefits of sdlc
===========
	Ø Provide a clear road map
	Ø Reduces risk of projects failures
	Ø Help in accurate planning and schedule 
	Ø Enhance project monitoring and control
	Ø Promotes better  documentation and communication 


IT env
======

	1. Dev env
	2. QA env
	3. Staging/UAT env
	4. Prod env


Maven
=======

	Ø Autoamtion build tool
	Ø Pom.xml:- project object model

War:- web app archive:- pkg web app only
Jar:- java archive:- standalone java app
Ear:- enterprise app archive :- pkg enterprise app


Apache tomcat:- it’s a web server
